      <h4>1. Data Collection</h4>
      <p>We collect your email, your vibes, your unspoken rizz, and any Fred memes you upload. We also know when you’re watching goofy ahh TikToks at 2AM.</p>

      <h4>2. Cookies 🍪</h4>
      <p>Yes, we use cookies. Not the chocolate chip kind, the boring web kind. But if you send us real cookies we will in fact eat them.</p>

      <h4>3. Data Sharing</h4>
      <p>We share your data with absolutely nobody, except maybe Fred. He’s chill. Sometimes he leaks stuff to his group chat though 🤷‍♂️.</p>

      <h4>4. Security</h4>
      <p>Our security system is literally just Fred standing at the server door with a Nerf gun. Proceed at your own risk.</p>

      <h4>5. Your Rights</h4>
      <p>You have the right to: vibe, unsubscribe, skibidi, and say “nah bro I’m out” at any time. But your memes stay here forever. Sorry not sorry.</p>

      <h4>6. Updates</h4>
      <p>We may update this policy whenever Fred feels like it. No emails, no warnings. Just vibes.</p>
