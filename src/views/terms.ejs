              <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
              <p class="text-muted legal-text mb-4">
                By accessing and using <strong>OnlyFreds</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "The Service" or "The Pizzeria"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please exit the building immediately before the doors lock automatically at midnight.
              </p>

              <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">2. Liability Waiver</h2>
              <p class="text-muted legal-text mb-4">
                OnlyFreds shall not be held liable for any personal injury, loss of sleep, or sudden disappearances occurring while browsing our products. Specifically:
              </p>
              <ul class="text-muted mb-4">
                <li>We are not responsible if purchased plushies move on their own when unobserved.</li>
                <li>Any "hallucinations" of gold-colored bears are strictly the user's responsibility.</li>
                <li>OnlyFreds disclaims all liability for electrical surges, power outages, or animatronic malfunctions resulting in "The Bite."</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">3. Product Descriptions</h2>
              <p class="text-muted legal-text mb-4">
                We attempt to be as accurate as possible. However, OnlyFreds does not warrant that product descriptions are error-free. A "Cute Plushie" may legally be defined as a "Cursed Artifact" in some jurisdictions. Purchase at your own risk.
              </p>

              <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">4. Payment & Refunds</h2>
              <p class="text-muted legal-text mb-4">
                All sales are final. Once you adopt a Fred, it is bound to you forever. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Refunds are only issued if the product actively tries to dismantle your computer. Proof of sentient behavior (video evidence) is required for all claims.
              </p>

              <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">5. User Conduct</h2>
              <p class="text-muted legal-text mb-4">
                Users agree not to use the site to:
              </p>
              <ul class="text-muted mb-4">
                <li>Upload viruses, malware, or remnants of William Afton.</li>
                <li>Harass the night guard in the comment sections.</li>
                <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer the animatronic AI.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">6. Governing Law</h2>
              <p class="text-muted legal-text mb-0">
                These Terms shall be governed by the laws of <strong>Utah</strong> (or wherever the Pizzeria is currently hiding), without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved via a flashlight tag match in the main dining area.
              </p>
